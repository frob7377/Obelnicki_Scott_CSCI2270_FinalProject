Final Project

Our final project is a 20-ish questions program. We are using a system of vectors and two
structures to hold our questions and answers.  The user is able to navigate the answers based
on simple yes or no questions.  The game is also fully scalable, while in the menu the user
is able to add both questions and answers so that the game grows as it is used.  And so that
we do not loose all the great user content, the information is saved in a text file called
‘answers.txt’.
