Final Project

Our final project will be a 20 questions program. We are thinking about using a n-ary tree to
build a decision tree that will ask questions based on user responses. We would like to write
the responses to a file that the program will read each time as it is loaded into memory. This
will allow persistence between users. Another element we are considering incorporating is
balancing the tree based on which questions are best at parsing information. Our final element
would be to use a algorithm similar to a graph's shortest path algorithm to allow the user to
input an answer and have the program predict how many questions it would take to guess that
answers.
