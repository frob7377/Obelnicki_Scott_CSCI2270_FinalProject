# Obelnicki_Scott_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Phase 2 Readme

Project Summary
Our final project is a 20-ish questions program. We are using a system of vectors and two
structures to hold our questions and answers.  The user is able to navigate the answersbased on simple yes or no questions.  The game is also fully scalable, while in the menu the user is able to add both questions and answers so that the game grows as it is used.  And so that we do not loose all the great user content, the information is saved in a text file that ‘answers.txt’.

How to Run
There is a class header file called, TwentyQuestions.h, a class library called TwentyQuestions.cpp, and a command file from which game menu is run called main.cpp.

The file ‘answers.txt’ should be run as a command line argument.

These four file and a c++ compiler are all that you will need to run the game.  No special operations, outside those used to do the last 10 or so assignments, are necessary.
